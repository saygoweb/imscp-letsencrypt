# iMSCP LetsEncrypt Plugin - Changelog

## Version 2.0.2

* Fix a failing certbot request putting the whole plugin into an error state. A domain whose
  certificate request fails, for instance because its DNS has not propagated yet, is now given
  the 'error' status, the reason reported by certbot is recorded as its note, and an error icon
  is shown against it. The customer can retry by re-enabling the domain.

  a. by using the local resolver and b. by the use of wildcard subdomains
